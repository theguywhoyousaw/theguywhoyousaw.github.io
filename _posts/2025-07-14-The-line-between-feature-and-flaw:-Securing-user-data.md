## The line between feature and flaw: Securing user data

User data is clearly of importance, however in disorganised development teams, mistakes can and do happen.

This short writeup discusses a significant data privacy breach, found in a popular mobile app with 100's of thousands of users.
I strongly recommend interested individuals to disclose security issues privately, confidentially, and in a friendly manner.
It is never the goal of any legitimate reasearcher to get into legal complications, which can happen depending on how the company is informed.

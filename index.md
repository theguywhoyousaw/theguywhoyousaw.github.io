## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a reverse engineer focused on low-level systems and software internals.

While most of my work remains private, I occasionally share proof-of-concepts (PoCs) designed to spark curiosity and inspire others to build upon them.
Think of these contributions as starting points for a more complete usage case.

If you find value in my work and use it as inspiration, Iâ€™d appreciate a credit.
